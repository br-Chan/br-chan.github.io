				Hi, I'm a Penultimate Software Engineering student at the
				University of Auckland.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm passionate in helping other people and solving problems, and
				I'm always ready to learn new things. I'm seeking the
				opportunity for my next summer internship to put my knowledge
				and motivation to practice, further develop soft skills, and
				gain even more industry experience.
			</p>
			<p>
				I love to learn, create and do things - usually all 3 at once.
