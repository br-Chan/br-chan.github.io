      Hi, I'm a Penultimate Software Engineering student at the University of Auckland. I'm
      passionate in helping other people and solving problems, and I'm always ready to learn new
      things. I'm seeking the opportunity for my next summer internship to put my knowledge and
      motivation to practice, further develop soft skills, and gain even more industry experience. I
      love to learn, create and do things - usually all 3 at once.
